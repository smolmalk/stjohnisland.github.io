<h2> The Hidden Gem </h2>
<br>

<p> Gardens by the Bay, Marina Barrage, Singapore Botanic Gardens, these places allows you to carry out many outdoor activities such as sightseeing, picnics or flying a kite. 
But these popular places are always crowded and can get boring after a few visits hence this hidden gem located off mainland Singapore can provide you with that change in pace from the city life and new adventures.
<br>
Saint John’s Island is located close to the south of the mainland Singapore. 
It used to be a quarantine site for immigrants who contracted cholera, beri-beri and leprosy. 
It also had a rehabilitation centre for drug abusers and house political prisoners. 
However today, it is a popular offshore island destination for many outdoor activities for those who appreciates nature and craves for a change of scenery from tall skyscrapers to tall trees and the island’s cats.
